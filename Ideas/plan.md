# Plan

## **Do not** forget to answer questions:
1. Where to/from do people migrate?
2. Why do they migrate?
3. What are the consequences of migration?

## TO-DO list:

 
### Tables (raw data)
- **delete** 
    * _immigration_country_born.csv_ 
        + this table has less data than immigration_citizenship.csv, yet it serves exactly the same purpose. 
    * _immigration_development_citizenship.csv_
        + table serves no purpose
    * _immigration_development_country_born.csv_
        + table serves no purpose
        
- **redo**
    * _emigration_country_born.csv_ 
        + this table is chaotic, needs explanation
    * _housing_prices.csv_ [Adam]
        + this table needs serious work, melting quarterly data into yearly
        + could be worth considering to re-import the table with yearly data (if possible)
- **add**
  	* immigration_citizenship **EXPANDED** [Erik]
		+ import a much larger version of _immigration_citizenship.csv_ table
		+ add all countries, edit them to group into regions
			- Eastern Europe
			- Northern Europe
			- Western & Central Europe
			- Southern Europe
			- Balkans
			- Middle east & North Africa
			- Central Asia
			- South Asia (India, Bangladesh etc.)
			- Southeast Asia
			- East Asia
			- Sub-Saharan Africa
			- North America
			- Latin America
			- Australia & Oceania
    * Crime statistics 
    * Economy: HDI, GDP (Nominal & PPP), welfare spending
    * religion data
    * Slovakia data (Optional)
    
### To fix
- Delete broken graphs [Andrej]
    * many graphs have not enough data, making them useless clutter
    * change functions that generate graphs so that they filter and refuse to generate graphs that are not sufficient
    
- fix wrong graph data [Andrej]
    * numbers that make no sense
        
### What to do next
- What type of migrants go to which country [Andrej ?]
    * age, gender, origin country
    * map, pie charts

- Describe flow of migrants [?]
    * show the flow of migrants on a map
    * which countries gain/lose people due to migration
    * lots of maps

- Why do people migrate to countries? [Erik, Jakub]
    * Compare immigration in countries with:
        + GDP (Nominal, PPP)
        + HDI
        + welfare
        + employment
    * to prove the point that people migrate for economic reasons
    * compare for every country
    * compare for all countries (or regions)
    * add markers for important historical events
    
- Consequences of migration [Adam ?]
    + how does migration affect:
        - housing prices
        - criminality
        - economy
        - unemployment

- Asylum statistics [Aďo]
    * percentage accepted over the years, for every country
    * which groups are accepted 
        + age
    * compare with GDP
- Comparison between specific countrie [Aďo]
    * differences in specific countries
- Show situation in Slovakia (Optional)
    * Which counties gain/lose people due to migration
    * GDP, HDI of regions
    
        

### Optional
- Second-level subdivisions
    * show migration on second level subdivisions
- focus on some countries:
    * Slovakia
    * Germany
