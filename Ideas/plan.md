# Plan

## Do not forget to answer questions:
1. Where to/from do people migrate?
2. Why do they migrate?
3. What are the consequences of migration?

## TO-DO list:

 
### Tables (raw data)
- **delete** 
    * _immigration_country_born.csv_ 
        + this table has less data than immigration_citizenship.csv, yet it serves exactly the same purpose. 
    * _immigration_development_citizenship.csv_
        + table serves no purpose
    * _immigration_development_country_born.csv_
        + table serves no purpose
        
- **redo**
    * _emigration_country_born.csv_ 
        + this table is chaotic, needs re-importing and subsequent reformatting
    * _housing_prices.csv_
        + this table needs serious work, melting quarterly data into yearly
        + could be worth considering to re-import the table with yearly data (if possible)
- **add**
    * crime statistics
    * HDI, GDP (Nominal & PPP), 
    
### To fix
- Delete broken graphs
    * many graphs have not enough data, making them useless clutter
    * change functions that generate graphs so that they filter and refuse to generate graphs that are not sufficient
   
- fix wrong graph data
    * 
        
### What to do next
- emigration per capita vs quality of live (GDP, HDI)
    * to prove the point that people migrate for economic reasons
- asylum statistics
    * percentage accepted over the years
    * which groups are accepted
- What type of migrants go to which country
    * age, gender, origin country
    * map, pie charts
-
